# burger

This is a Heroku app. It can be accessed by visiting this line: https://dry-beyond-68456.herokuapp.com/

Currently, this app is not deployed properly to Heroku. There was a problem deploying the mySQL database. It will be updated once the deployment problems are sorted out.

Once it is functional, the user may enter a burger they'd like to eat by typing it into the text field and clicking "submit". They may eat a burger by clicking the "DEVOUR" button next to the burger's name. Burgers that have already been devoured will appear on the right hand side.
