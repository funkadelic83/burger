# burger

This is a Heroku app. The user may enter a burger they'd like to eat by typing it into the text field and clicking "submit". They may eat a burger by clicking the "DEVOUR" button next to the burger's name. Burgers that have already been devoured will appear on the right hand side.

Currently, this app is not deployed properly to Heroku. There was a problem deploying the mySQL database. It will be updated once the deployment problems are sorted out.
